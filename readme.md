[**nlcst**][nlcst] utility to check if a node is meant literally.

Useful if a tool wants to exclude values that are possibly void of meaning.
For example, a spell-checker could exclude these literal words, thus not warning
about “monsieur”.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install nlcst-is-literal
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.txt`:

```txt
The word “foo” is meant as a literal.

The word «bar» is meant as a literal.

The word (baz) is meant as a literal.

The word, qux, is meant as a literal.

The word — quux — is meant as a literal.
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var unified = require('unified')
var english = require('retext-english')
var visit = require('unist-util-visit')
var toString = require('nlcst-to-string')
var literal = require('nlcst-is-literal')

var file = vfile.readSync('example.txt')

var tree = unified()
  .use(english)
  .parse(file)

visit(tree, 'WordNode', visitor)

function visitor(node, index, parent) {
  if (literal(parent, index)) {
    console.log(toString(node))
  }
}
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```txt
foo
bar
baz
qux
quux
```

## API

### `isLiteral(parent, index|child)`

Check if the `child` in `parent` is enclosed by matching delimiters.
If `index` is given, the [child][] of `parent` at that [index][] is checked.

For example, `foo` is literal in the following samples:

*   `Foo - is meant as a literal.`
*   `Meant as a literal is - foo.`
*   `The word “foo” is meant as a literal.`
